    <h3>Awesome Cheese Burger</h3>
    <p>My mom used to make these hamburger buns all the time. They are so easy to make: light and fluffy as well as beautiful to look at. I get raves whenever I make them. Try using them for sandwich rolls too--delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the milk, 1 cup of water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil then remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm. If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine pasta with tomatoes, cheese, salami, pepperoni, green pepper, olives, and pimentos in a large bowl. Pour in salad dressing; toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
